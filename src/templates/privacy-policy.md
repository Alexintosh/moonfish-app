# Privacy Policy

_Your privacy is critically important to us. At { platformName }, we have a few fundamental principles_

- We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your age, gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
- We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
- We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.
- We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.

Below is our privacy policy, which incorporates these goals.

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team at { contactEmailAddress }.

{ platformName } (“{ platformName }”) operates { platformWebsiteUrl} and associated applications and services, including the { platformName } API and developer portal. It is { platformName }’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website, applications and services.

## Website Visitors and Users

Like most online website and application operators, { platformName } collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. { platformName }’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how { platformName }’s users use its website. From time to time, { platformName } may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its services.

{ platformName } also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for both website visitors and logged in users. { platformName } only discloses user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to { platformName } choose to interact with { platformName } in ways that require { platformName } to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that { platformName } gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users who create a { platformName } account to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with { platformName } – by upgrading to a premium subscription, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.

In each case, { platformName } collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with { platformName }. { platformName } does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

{ platformName } may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website and users of its applications and services. For instance, { platformName } may monitor (public) models created and display the most popular ones to others. However, { platformName } does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

{ platformName } discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on { platformName }’s behalf or to provide services available at { platformName }, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using { platformName }, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. { platformName } will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, { platformName } discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when { platformName } believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of { platformName }, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a { platformName } and have supplied your email address, { platformName } may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with { platformName } and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. { platformName } takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. They are also a food that can be eaten. { platformName } uses cookies to help { platformName } identify and track visitors, their usage of { platformName }, and their website access preferences. { platformName } visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using { platformName }, with the drawback that certain features of { platformName } may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If { platformName }, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that { platformName } goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of { platformName } may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Privacy Policy Changes

{ platformName } may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in { platformName }’s sole discretion. { platformName } encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a { platformName } account, you should also check your email or dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of { platformName } after any change is made to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
