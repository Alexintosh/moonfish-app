# Token Sale Terms and Conditions

The following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the sale of cryptographic tokens – { tokenName } – that is
required to transact on the { platformName } (“{ platformName }”) to purchasers of { tokenName }
(“Purchasers” collectively, and “Purchaser” individually). This document is not a solicitation for investment
and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. As described further below,
transactions on the { platformName } may require payments of a token to create transactions. Without
payment for operations, the system may become vulnerable to attack, and thus would not be viable, and
would grind to a halt. The payments, in the form of block rewards and transaction fees, are made to
owners of computational resources (miners) in exchange for securing the { platformName }'s network
and for transmitting transactions. This document describes the initial sale in which the token ({ tokenName }) is
sold, as well as the perpetual coordinated spontaneous creation of the “{ tokenName } coins” Parties may be
interested in purchasing { tokenName } in the initial sale to support the development of the { platformName },
and to prepare for their eventual use of the { platformName } when it is launched. Individuals,
businesses, and other organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring
{ tokenName } early in the initial sale versus waiting to purchase { tokenName } on open, third-party exchanges once the
system is operational and when they or their businesses require { tokenName } to operate.

Ownership of { tokenName } carries no rights express or implied. Purchases of { tokenName } are non-refundable.
Purchasers should have no expectation of influence over governance of the platform. By participating in
the sale of { tokenName }, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you have carefully reviewed the Terms
and fully understand the risks, costs, and benefits of purchasing { tokenName } and agree to be bound by these
Terms. As set forth below, you further represent and warrant that, to the extent permitted by law, you are
authorized to purchase { tokenName } in your relevant jurisdiction, are of a legal age to be bound by these
Terms, and will not hold { tokenName }, its parent and affiliates, and the officers, directors, agents, joint ventures,
employees and suppliers of { tokenName } or our parent or affiliates, now or in the future and any other member
of the { platformName } Team liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising
out of, or in any way connected to the sale of { tokenName }.

## EXPERTISE

Purchases of { tokenName } should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have
significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like
bitcoin (“BTC”), and blockchain based software systems. Purchasers should have functional
understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic tokens.
While the { platformName } Team will be available to assist Purchasers of { tokenName } during and after the sale, { tokenName }
will not be responsible for lost BTC or { tokenName } resulting from actions taken by, or omitted by Purchasers.
Note, in particular, that { tokenName } Purchasers should take great care to write down their wallet password and
not lose it so as to be sure that they will be able to access their { tokenName } when it becomes available after
the initial sale. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not purchase { tokenName } or
participate in the pre-sale of { tokenName }.

## MARKET VOLATILITY

Cryptographic tokens that possess value in public markets, such as BTC, have demonstrated extreme
fluctuations in price over short periods of time on a regular basis. A Purchaser of { tokenName } should be
prepared to expect similar fluctuations, both down and up, in the price of { tokenName } denominated in BTC or
United States dollars (“USD”) or currencies of other such jurisdictions. Such fluctuations are due to
market forces and represent changes in the balance of supply and demand. { tokenName } cannot and does not
guarantee market liquidity for { tokenName } and therefore there may be periods of time in which { tokenName } is
difficult to buy. Additionally, due to different regulatory dictates in different jurisdictions and the inability of
citizens of certain countries to open accounts at exchanges located anywhere in the world, the liquidity of
{ tokenName } may be markedly different in different countries and this would likely be reflected in significant
price discrepancies. By purchasing { tokenName }, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you fully
understand that { tokenName } may experience volatility in pricing and will not seek to hold any of the { platformName }
Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any
way connected to, the sale of { tokenName }.

## RISKS

The purchase of { tokenName } carries with it a number of risks. Prior to purchasing { tokenName }, you should carefully
consider the risks listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, or
tax professional. If any of the following risks are unacceptable to you, you should not purchase { tokenName }. By
purchasing { tokenName }, and to the extent permitted by law, you are agreeing not to hold any of the { platformName }
Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any
way connected, to the sale of { tokenName }, including losses associated with the risks set forth below.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 1. Overview of Initial Sale of { tokenName }

Purchasers in the initial sale will acquire { tokenName }s in exchange for other cryptographic currencies at current rates
over a period of both the presale and main sale. Purchasers of { tokenName }s in the initial sale will be
granted user accounts on the { platformName } website that will enable them to claim their purchase once
the sale ends and a final audit has been completed.

### 2. Timing of Sale

The presale will begin the dates listed on the { platformName } website. Though it does not currently anticipate doing so, { tokenName } also
reserves the right to shorten the sale duration for any reason.

### 3. { tokenName } Pricing

Details of the pricing will be available once the whitelist period finishes.

### 4. Disclosure of Purchases

In the spirit of openness, and to enable { tokenName } Purchasers to have as much information as
possible to guide their decision making process, { tokenName } will disclose in real time the total number
of { tokenName } sold to enable the Purchaser to develop an understanding of the size of the existing
{ tokenName } pool at the time of their { tokenName } purchase.

### 5. Purchase of { tokenName } from the { platformName } platform

{ platformName } will maintain an investor platform, which can be used to purchase { tokenName }s. This platform
will be available on the { platformName } website ({ platformWebsiteUrl }) Any questions about the purchase of
{ tokenName } should be directed to { contactEmailAddress }

### 6. Independent Confirmation of Purchases

During the purchase process on the { platformWebsiteUrl } website, { tokenName } will provide Purchasers with a
unique intermediary BTC or ETH address. Using this address, Purchasers can track and confirm
that the Purchaser’s BTC or ETH has been received at that address and has been subsequently
and automatically sent to the initial address. Knowledge of the unique intermediary BTC or ETH
address does not constitute a purchase receipt or indicate in any way that any party possessing
such knowledge has rights to or ownership of the purchased { tokenName }.

### 7. { tokenName } Will Only Be Available For Sale on the { platformName } Website

{ platformName } will only sell { tokenName } through the { platformName } website, available at { platformWebsiteUrl }. To the
extent that any third-party website or service offers { tokenName } for sale during the initial sale or
facilitates the sale or transfer of { tokenName } in any way during the initial sale or at any time up to the
release of the initial block, such third-party websites or services are not sanctioned by { platformName } or
its parents and affiliates and have no relationship in any way with the { platformName } Parties. As a
result, { platformName } prohibits the use of these third-party websites or services for the purchase of
{ tokenName } prior to the end of the initial sale.

### 8. Certain Risks Associated with the Purchase of { tokenName }

The purchase of { tokenName } carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing { tokenName }, the Purchaser
should carefully consider the below risks and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer,
accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to determining whether to purchase { tokenName }.

- a. It is possible that the value of BTC/ETH will drop significantly in the future, depriving { platformName } of sufficient resources to continue to operate. In order to guard against this risk, { platformName } intends to periodically convert proceeds from the sale of { tokenName } into US dollars instead of BTC/ETH.
- b. As noted above, { tokenName } will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password selected by the Purchaser. If a Purchaser of { tokenName } does not maintain an accurate record of their password, this may lead to the loss of { tokenName }. As a result, Purchasers must safely store their password in one or more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location. In order to access one’s { tokenName } the password that the Purchaser entered is required; loss of this may lead to the loss of a Purchaser’s { tokenName }.
- c. Cryptocurrencies have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the globe. The { platformName } Platform and { tokenName } could be impacted by one or more regulatory enquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of { platformName } to continue to develop the { platformName } Platform.
- d. Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to steal the BTC revenue from the initial sale, thus potentially impacting the ability of { platformName } to develop the { platformName } Platform and operate { platformName }. To account for this risk, { platformName } has and will continue to implement comprehensive security precautions to safeguard the BTC obtained from the
sale of { tokenName }. Multi-factor security measures will be taken to protect BTC and { tokenName }
including physical elements, Shamir’s Secret Sharing Algorithm, multisignature keys, BIP
32, anti-spear-phishing procedures, splitting of funds, hot/cold wallet partitioning and
diversification. Moreover, regular security audits of hot and cold wallets will be conducted
by internal and external teams.
- e. The { platformName } Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the { platformName } Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the { platformName } Parties, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the { platformName } Platform causing the system to lose { tokenName } stored in one or more Purchaser accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the { platformName } Platform. { platformName } has taken steps to build, maintain, and secure the infrastructure of the { platformName } Platform, and will continue to do so after the initial sale. For example, { platformName } intends to hire external consultants on a periodic basis to assess and audit the security of the { platformName } Platform and will work with cryptography and security experts to develop and employ best practices to audit the Platform.
- f. { tokenName } is a new product, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect the value of { tokenName }. The factors affecting the further development of the digital assets industry, as well as the { platformName } Platform, include: i. continued worldwide growth in the
adoption and use of { tokenName } and other digital assets; ii. government and quasigovernment regulation of { tokenName } and other digital assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the { platformName } Platform or similar digital asset systems; iii. the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the { platformName } Platform; iv. changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; v. the availability and popularity of other similar products; and vi. general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to the { platformName } and digital assets.
- g. Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the { platformName } Platform. Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in the { platformName } Platform’s long-term viability or the ability of end-users to hold and transfer { tokenName } may adversely affect the value of { tokenName }. Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent { tokenName } and other end-users from accessing the { platformName } Platform or holding or transferring their { tokenName }s.
- h. Cryptocurrency exchanges on which { tokenName } may trade may be relatively new and largely unregulated and may therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products. To the extent that the cryptocurrency exchanges representing a substantial portion of the volume in { tokenName } trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such cryptocurrency exchange failures may result in a reduction in the price and can adversely affect the value of { tokenName }. A lack of stability in the cryptocurrency exchanges and the closure or temporary shutdown of cryptocurrency exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may reduce confidence in the { platformName } Platform and result in greater volatility in the price. i. Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of { tokenName }, which could result in a reduction in the price and adversely affect the value of a { tokenName }. Digital assets such as { tokenName }, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of transacting, and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events. Large scale sales of { tokenName } would result in a reduction in the price and adversely affect the value of an { tokenName }.
- j. It is possible that a digital asset other than { tokenName } could have features that make it more desirable to a material portion of the digital asset user base, resulting in a reduction in demand for an { tokenName }, which could have a negative impact on the use and price of { tokenName }. It is possible that a comparable product could become materially popular due to either a perceived or exposed shortcoming of the { platformName } Platform that is not immediately addressed by the { platformName } Team, or a perceived advantage of a comparable product that includes features not incorporated into { tokenName }. If this product obtains significant market share, it could have a negative impact on the demand for, and price of, an { tokenName }.
- k. { tokenName } transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred { tokenName }s may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed { tokenName } transactions could adversely affect the value of an { tokenName }. { tokenName } transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the processing power on the { platformName } Platform. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of { tokenName }s or a theft of { tokenName } generally will not be reversible and there may be no compensation for any such transfer or theft. Such loss could adversely affect the value of an { tokenName }.
- l. { platformName } may not have adequate sources of recovery if { tokenName }s are lost, stolen or destroyed. If { platformName }'s or issuer's { tokenName }'s are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to { platformName } or issuer, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the claim.

### 9. All Purchases of { tokenName } Are Non-Refundable ALL PURCHASES OF { tokenName } ARE FINAL.

PURCHASES OF { tokenName } ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. BY PURCHASING { tokenName }, THE
PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER { platformName } NOR ANY OTHER OF THE
{ platformName } PARTIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND  THAT THE PURCHASER WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR
ANY { tokenName } THAT IS NOT USED OR REMAINS UNUSED.

### 10. Taxation of { tokenName } and Taxation Related to the Initial Sale

{ platformName } makes no representations concerning the tax implications of the sale of { tokenName } or the
possession or use of { tokenName }. The Purchaser bears the sole responsibility to determine if the
purchase of { tokenName } with BTC or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of { tokenName }
over time has tax implications for the Purchaser in the Purchaser’s home jurisdiction. By
purchasing { tokenName }, and to the extent permitted by law, the Purchaser agrees not to hold any of
the { platformName } Parties liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the purchase of
{ tokenName }.

### 11. Privacy

Although { platformName } requires that Purchasers provide an email address, { platformName } will not publish
any identifying information related to an { tokenName } purchase, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser. Purchasers may be contacted by email by { platformName } regarding a purchase. Such
emails will be informational only. { platformName } will not request any information from Purchasers in an
email.

### 12. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE PURCHASER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE PURCHASER IS PURCHASING { tokenName }
AT THE PURCHASER’S SOLE RISK AND THAT { tokenName } IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT
PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW WITH ANY LEGALLY REQUIRED WARRANTY
PERIOD TO THE SHORTER OF THIRTY DAYS FROM FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD
REQUIRED). WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE { platformName } PARTIES
WARRANT THAT THE PROCESS FOR PURCHASING { tokenName } WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
ERROR-FREE.

### 13. Limitations Waiver of Liability

THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED
HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR
RELATED TO USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, { tokenName } OR THE { platformName } PLATFORM UNDER
ANY CAUSE OR ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NONE OF THE EDC PARTIES SHALL BE
LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA, IN ANY WAY
WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, OR PURCHASE OF,
OR INABILITY TO PURCHASE, { tokenName }. THE PURCHASER FURTHER SPECIFICALLY
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT { platformName } PARTIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF
THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER PURCHASERS OF { tokenName }, AND THAT THE RISK OF
PURCHASING AND USING { tokenName } RESTS ENTIRELY WITH THE PURCHASER. TO THE
EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL
ANY OF THE { platformName } PARTIES BE LIABLE TO ANY PURCHASER FOR MORE THAN THE
AMOUNT THE PURCHASER HAVE PAID TO { platformName } FOR THE PURCHASE OF { tokenName }.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR
THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES.
THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION AND ELSEWHERE IN
THE TERMS MAY NOT APPLY TO A PURCHASER. IN PARTICULAR, NOTHING IN THESE
TERMS SHALL AFFECT THE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF ANY PURCHASER OR EXCLUDE
INJURY ARISING FROM ANY WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD OF { platformName }.

### 14. Dispute Resolution

- a. { platformName } and Purchaser (the “Parties”) agree to make good faith efforts to resolve any dispute, controversy or claim arising between them relating to this pre-sale and their respective rights and obligations hereunder arising under this Agreement (a “Dispute”).
- b. If the Parties, or their designated representatives, are unable to resolve the Dispute within ten (10) business days after referral of the matter to them, the Parties will submit the Dispute for resolution pursuant to paragraph c. of this Section.
- c. Except with respect to Disputes concerning the right of either Party to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an interim or interlocutory injunction or other provisional remedy to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable harm or (ii) any Disputes that may arise in connection with a breach of a Party’s obligations of confidentiality hereunder, if any Dispute is not resolved pursuant to paragraphs a. and b. above, the Parties will, acting reasonably, agree mutually on the forum for resolution of the Dispute by arbitration as set out in this Section.
- d. After the completion of the procedures set forth in paragraph b. and agreement by the Parties to enter into binding arbitration in accordance with paragraph c. of this Section, either Party may within thirty (30) calendar days refer the Dispute to arbitration by serving written notice of its intention to arbitrate the Dispute to the other Party.

### 15. Force Majeure

{ platformName } is not liable for failure to perform solely caused by:

- unavoidable casualty,
- delays in delivery of materials,
- embargoes,
- government orders,
- acts of civil or military authorities,
- acts by common carriers,
- emergency conditions (including weather conditions),
- or any similar unforeseen event that renders performance commercially implausible.

If an event of force majeure occurs, the party injured by the other’s inability to perform may elect
to suspend the Agreement, in whole or part, for the duration of the force majeure circumstances.
The party experiencing the force majeure circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the
injured party in all reasonable ways to minimize the impact of force majeure on the injured party.

### 16. Complete Agreement

These Terms set forth the entire understanding between each Purchaser and { platformName } with
respect to the purchase and sale of { tokenName }. For facts relating to the sale and purchase, the
Purchaser agrees to rely only on these two documents in determining purchase decisions and
understands that these documents govern the sale of { tokenName } and supersede any public
statements about the initial sale made by third parties or by { platformName } Team or individuals
associated with any { platformName } Parties, past and present and during the initial sale.

### 17. Severability

The Purchaser and { platformName } agree that if any portion of these Terms is found illegal or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the
validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the
remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.

### 18. No Waiver

The failure of { platformName } to require or enforce strict performance by the Purchaser of any provision
of these Terms or { platformName }’s failure to exercise any right under these agreements shall not be
construed as a waiver or relinquishment of { platformName } 's right to assert or rely upon any such
provision or right in that or any other instance. The express waiver by { platformName } of any provision,
condition, or requirement of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to
comply with such provision, condition or requirement. Except as expressly and specifically set
forth in this these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or
omissions by { platformName } shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor be legally binding,
unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by the Purchaser and a duly appointed
officer, employee, or agent of { platformName }.

### 19. Updates to the Terms and Conditions of the { tokenName } Initial Sale

{ platformName } reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of
the Terms at any time during the sale by posting the amended Terms on the { platformName } website
({ platformWebsiteUrl }). Any Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted such changes by
purchasing { tokenName }. The Terms may not be otherwise amended except in a signed writing
executed by both the Purchaser and { platformName }. For purposes of this agreement, "writing" does not
include an e-mail message and a signature does not include an electronic signature. If at any
point you do not agree to any portion of the then-current version of the Terms, you should not
purchase { tokenName }.

### 20. Cooperation with Legal Authorities

{ platformName } will cooperate with all law enforcement enquiries, subpoenas, or requests provided they
are fully supported and documented by the law in the relevant jurisdictions. In accord with one of
the core principles of the { platformName } project — transparency — { platformName } will endeavor to publish
any legal enquiries upon receipt.
